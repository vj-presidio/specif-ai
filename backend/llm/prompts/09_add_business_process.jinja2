Provide the Business Process Flow that effectively addresses both the client's requests and the information from the provided Business and Product Requirements. 
final_business_process_flow must be a single paragraph, not a list or json format.
Generate an apt title for final_business_process_flow. Title should be a one-liner not more than 5 words.

Output Structure should be a valid JSON: Here is the sample Structure. Follow this exactly. Don't add or change the response JSON:

{
  "LLMreqt": {"title": <title>, "requirement": "<final_business_process_flow>"}
}

Business Process Flow should be strictly in string format.

Please ensure the requirements are clear, concise, and comprehensive. Output only valid JSON. Do not include ```json ``` on start and end of the response.
