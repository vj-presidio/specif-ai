#### ✨ Agentic Solution Requirement Generation Flow

Specif AI utilises the Langgraph framework to deliver an efficient agentic workflow, enhancing the creation of solution requirements with precision. Following are the key phases involved:

- **Context Gathering Phase:** 
  - **Summarisation:** Analyses solution metadata and conversation history, employing summarisation to manage conversation context data effectively.
  - **Context Gathering:** Integrates data from a Knowledge-Base, incorporating adaptable MCP server tools for enhanced flexibility.
  - **Decision Point:** Assesses the need for Large Language Model (LLM) tool execution, iterating until the tool executions phase is complete.
  - **Data Consolidation** Organises data into a structured ReferenceInfo format.
- **Requirement Generation Phase**: The structured output from previous phase drives the creation of Business Requirements Document (BRD), Product Requirements Document (PRD), Non-functional Requirements Document (NFR) and User Interface Requirements (UIR). 

This Agentic architecture ensures seamless task orchestration and accelerates the solution  creation process.

### 🔌 Integrations

Specifai seamlessly integrates with popular tools to enhance your workflow:

#### Jira Integration
The stories and tasks generated as part of the solutions can be used to create actual stories and tasks in your Jira instance using the Jira integration provided by the application. Features include:
- Automatic story and task creation in Jira.
- Bulk export capabilities.

For Jira setup instructions, please refer to our [Jira Setup Guide](/ui/JIRA-README.md).

#### AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base
The enterprise knowledge base is integrated with AI-powered chat to enhance suggestions and enable iterative conversations for Business Requirement Documents (BRDs), Product Requirement Documents (PRDs), Non-functional Requirements, User Stories, and Tasks. Features include: 

- Enhanced chat suggestions through enterprise knowledge.
- Context-aware requirement generation.
- Historical data integration.

## 🧠 Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

<div align="center">
  <em>Supercharge your development workflow with powerful tools and knowledge bases through the flexible Model Context Protocol (MCP)</em>
</div>

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a powerful integration framework that enables Specifai to connect with external tools, services, and knowledge bases. This extensible architecture allows you to enhance your requirement generation workflow with custom capabilities while maintaining a seamless user experience.
